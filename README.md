# **DEFAULT TF2 HUD FILES**

This repository contains all the files related to the TF2 UI

I opted to keep the `resource` and `scripts` folders separeted from the rest to be easier to browse as they hold the most common files which ultimately is what 99% of the HUD developers are going to ever need.

As for the other folders:

`#HL2 Files:` Contains the extracted folders from **hl2_misc_dir.vpk**

`#Platform Files:` Contains the extracted folders from **platform_misc_dir.vpk**

`#TF2 Files:` Contains the extracted folders from **tf2_misc_dir.vpk**
